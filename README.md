 Nowadays each country seeks to improve its educational system because this later is the pillar of any society, that why they invest with their economic, human and pedagogic resources so as to search for the best way to achieve this great goal which societies can benefit a lot from it. These measures and efforts taken are just concentrated to boost methods of teaching, but it’s still insufficient and limited to come up with excellent results because they aren’t directed to give more importance to the psychology and physical of learners. 

For that, we need to bring in some betterment which consist on taking into consideration the different attitudes and behaviors of the students in order to establish a good understanding of the problems which intervene in their school lives and which prevent the good learning.

So as to put this betterment into work, we ought to adopt an educational system which is different from the classical one because it would be difficult to achieve it while this system contains obsolete components. And that’s where the role of “Smart Schools” come into play to contribute to the quality of teaching making the environment of students comfortable for good learning and performance.

In this context, we decide to acquire information about the behavior of students to orienting them towards adopting the best manner for their school lives, 
by using “Smart Jacket” conceived with advanced technologies including IoT and embedded system techniques.
Our solution could be interesting when speaking about quality of education, it provides accurate tracking from where we can find out easily their problems which can help us to analyzethem and finding better solutions to deal with them.

This report summarizes the work we have done. It is organized into chapters as follows:

	Inthe first chapter,we present the Smart School with its structure and its role in student life and we show how the integration of Smart Jacket into Smart School could be beneficial.

After that, in the second chapter we will present the hardware and the software tools required for the carrying out of the project.Also, we will explain with great details how the design of Smart Jacket would be. 

	The final chapter contains the discussion, conclusion and the future work of the project.
